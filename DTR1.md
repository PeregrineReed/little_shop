#DTR: Define the Relationship
Group Member Names: Scott Thomas, Peregrine Balas, Zach Nager, April Dagonese

##Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
- Learn as much as possible
- Complete the required functionality (earn a 3 for each category)
- Feel very comfortable with AAA

##Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
- Peregrine cares about details; he will help make our site look pretty
- April is organized and bossy; she will also help make the site look pretty
- Scott is a team player; easygoing unless he feels strongly about a direction
- Zach is an "ideas guy"; good at high-level approaches for getting technical things done

- Sometimes the introverts might get really focused or need some solo time to absorb/process things; we'll try to be team-oriented but just know that it's not about you, it's just about our processing styles

##Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):
- We'll aim to stay at Turing until around 6-6:30pm when we need to complete work and adjust as necessary

##Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):
- Slack is available at any time, and we'll both respond as quickly as we're able to

##Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
- Everyone is eager to learn as much as possible, but particularly interested in strengthening ActiveRecord and AAA

##Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
- Every team member should work on every epic, unless otherwise discussed
- Team will review together earlier in the day and then break out if needed later on
- Priority should be given to anyone who wants to work on specific weaknesses
  - Peregrine wants to focus on ActiveRecord and statistics

##Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
- Nobody will merge their own commits; each of us with tag the other in a PR, and once approved, the partner will merge the commit
- Focus on unblocking team members before finishing your own work -- we'll Slack to let each other know something needs review
- Expectation will be that we start project work time with a standup/review session every day, but it will also be an option to bring the group in before classes start in the morning

- Generally aim to be ahead of the project schedule guidelines to create buffer
- Aim to deploy to Heroku a couple of days ahead of the due date

##Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
- April knows she can be bossy and opinionated -- please just tell her if it starts to bother you
- Zach doesn't have feelings; just tell him stuff
- Peregrine emphasizes specific and actionable and timely, please
- Scott says yes to all of the above
